server already stores a list of ipaddress
when a client connect, server sends back an index with getindexfromsystemaddress 

an array with a struct that contains the name and the index of that user

in send function has bool broadcast if on, will send message to all but one which is in the system address in the function
there is a system address that is empty, use this if you want to broadcast to all
